Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As we begin the initial stages of the new WhatsApp project, I am currently working on conducting a thorough requirements analysis to ensure we align the solution with business needs and user expectations. To proceed effectively, I would appreciate your assistance in providing some additional information and clarification on a few key areas.

Specifically, it would be helpful to understand:

The primary objectives and expected outcomes of the WhatsApp integration
Target user groups and any specific user journeys we should consider
Functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., message types, automation, response times)
Any compliance, security, or data privacy considerations
Integration points with existing systems or platforms
Having this information will enable us to define a clear scope and ensure that the solution we design is both effective and scalable.

Please let me know a convenient time for a quick discussion, or feel free to share any relevant documentation or notes you may already have.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Warm regards,
Mpho Mukwevho
Junior Business Analyst"
